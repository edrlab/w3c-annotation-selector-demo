 * other to the start of a subsequent chunk, they are not considered equal, even
 * though semantically they may be representing the same range of characters. To
 * test for such semantic equivalence, ensure that both inputs are normalised:
 * typically this means the range is shrunk to its narrowest equivalent, and (if
 * it is empty) positioned at its first equivalent.
